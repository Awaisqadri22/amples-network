                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How much does moving cleaning cost?</h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  How much does a moving house cleaning cost is a question we often get. Although we understand that the price of moving house cleaning is an important factor for you, it is important that you also take other factors into account when considering the question of how much moving house cleaning costs. Some things to consider are whether the company is easy to reach, is there a customer service? What is the quality of the assignments performed? How does the company work with social responsibility and working conditions? With that said, we can now take a closer look at what you can expect when you receive a price for moving house cleaning in an apartment or a price for moving house cleaning for a villa.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-justify">The price of moving cleaning is affected by a number of different factors, including these:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-justify">
                  <li>Size of the home and any additional spaces</li>
                  <li>Condition of the home</li>
                  <li>What city do you live in?</li>
                  <li>When you want the move-out cleaning done and when it should be finished</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  The price for moving house cleaning varies from home to home. In general, your moving house cleaning cost is usually based on the size of the home. It is not uncommon for there to be a minimum charge for moving house cleaning assignments. This is because it can take about the same amount of time to clean an apartment of 35-40 square meters as it does to clean an apartment of 50 square meters. What takes time is often the kitchen and bathroom, the remaining rooms can go relatively quickly as apartments in that size range often have a bathroom, a kitchen and about the same number of windows. This can sometimes lead to you receiving a lower price per square meter for moving house cleaning of a villa than the price per square meter for moving house cleaning of an apartment.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  Most commonly, you will receive a price for moving house cleaning per square meter. It is also possible to get a quote where the cleaning company has set a price for moving house cleaning per hour. If you want moving house cleaning during a weekend, it is also common to have a weekend supplement to cover the staff's OB salaries.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Moving cleaning price per sq m</h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  Regardless of whether you want a price for moving house cleaning of an apartment or a price for moving house cleaning of a villa, your moving house cleaning price will be based on how many square meters the home is and where it is located.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  At Qleano, we base our moving cleaning prices on per square meter. These often range between 30-36 SEK per square meter after the Rut deduction, depending on where in Sweden you live. Any additional space is then added to the basic price, which can be:

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-justify">

                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  Because each moving cleaning is unique, we do not work with a fixed moving cleaning price list.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Rut deduction for moving cleaning</h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  If you have been living in the home that is to be cleaned, you are also entitled to use the Rut deduction for moving-out cleaning. This means that you only pay half the labor cost. How much does moving-out cleaning cost without the right to the Rut deduction? About twice as much. While we are on the subject of taxes, in another post that you can read, we have addressed whether moving-out cleaning is a deductible cost or not when selling a home.

                <p className="text-lg text-justify">
                  As previously mentioned, the cost of moving house cleaning can differ depending on when you want help and where you live, among other things. There are also regional differences, where a certain residential area with, for example, old windows with bars takes longer to clean and clean windows than newly built apartment buildings with easy-to-clean surfaces. When you get a moving house cleaning quote, you shouldn't just look at the price per square meter. Go through the checklist to make sure everything is included in the cleaning and review the warranty terms. It happens that the cleaning doesn't always pass an initial cleaning inspection. It is then important that the cleaning company can come back quickly and fix any cleaning mistakes.
